  <h3>General Assembly Data Analytics Immersive Bootcamp (Oct. 2023 - Feb 2024)</h3>
  <p>I completed a 12 week full-time bootcamp through General Assembly focusing on Data Analytics.  My goal with this was to transition from my software engineering background to a focus on Data Engineering and Analytics.  This course was centered around learning to use the industry-standard tools Excel, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, and Python in a data analysis environment, as well as building several projects which you can check out below!  Coming from a background as a software engineer, I took well to using these tools in a new environment and enjoyed using them to gather, clean, and organize datasets in order to derive insights from them.  It also gave me a great opportunity to develop my presentation and public speaking skills, and working as a part of several teams in the cohort allowed me to share knowledge with people coming from a wide array of backgrounds.</p>
